        <h3>Previous Project</h3>
        <p>Previously, in another class we had to make our own website in a group, using html, css, and javacode.
            We even had to host this website on a site called Heroku. For this project, we decided to make a pomodore clock.
            This basically just tells you when to work and when you can releax. For example the most common version is 40 minutes of work followed by 10 minutes on break.
            This allows you to effectively work to the best of your abilities. I was in charge of designing the front end.
            It was a bit tricky to get working, as numbers intuitively count to 100, but clocks go to 60 seconds before going up. 
            It was very hard to get this working in the way we wanted, so we could run it an infinite number of times as you continue to work. 
            Another tricky part we built in was Spotify and YouTube integration, so you could choose whatever you wanted to listen to during your work and break time.

        <p>As you can see in the picture, we had a fully functioning website that would automatically switch sides as the timer went off. 
            So all the user needed to do was input what video or music he wanted to listen to on each side, then the app would do the rest.
            Overall it was a very fun project and I enjoyed it way more than any other project, as it is very similar to real world development and actually needing to get something working.
