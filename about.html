        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I am Aiden. I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Space. I have a huge intrest in anything automotive. Specifically I love watching F1. </p>
        <p>I have taken a very big liking to Space as it is my minor and I just started the classes. This led me to photography which I have also picted up an intrest in and have tried to take photos of everything, including the Milky Way. Which on a side note those photos didn't turn out very well!</p>
