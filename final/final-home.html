        <h2>Accessibility and it's Importance!</h2>
        <p>Accessibility is very important for website design. A humans ability to navigate through life can be very hard. 
            For example, think of a staircase. If you have a wheelchair, it can be near impossible to traverse that. That is why ramps, and elevators are so so important. 
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="/img/ramp.jpeg" alt="accessible ramp over one step">
            <figcaption>This shows a ramp that goes up over one step.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Now think of someone who cannot see trying to traverse a website. That would very hard on some of the worst designed websites.
            Univeral design gives people equal opportunities to obtain information, particpate in online activities, and engage with internet services. 
            The main idea is to allow all people to access the digital world, and give them the resources that the internet provides. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most important parts of accessible design is for a positive user experience. Websites designed with this in mind are usually 
            a way better experience for the user. They have clear navigation, easy to read content, and overall benefit every type of user.
