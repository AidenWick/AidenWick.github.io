        <h2>Accessibility and it's Importance!</h2>
        <p>Accessibility is very important for website design. A humans ability to navigate through life can be very hard. 
            For example, think of a staircase. If you have a wheelchair, it can be near impossible to traverse that. That is why ramps, and elevators are so so important.

        <p>
            Now think of someone who cannot see trying to traverse a website. That would very hard on some of the worst designed websites.
            Univeral design gives people equal opportunities to obtain information, particpate in online activities, and engage with internet services. 
            The main idea is to allow all people to access the digital world, and give them the resources that the internet provides. 
        </p>

            One of the most important parts of accessible design is for a positive user experience. Websites designed with this in mind are usually 
            a way better experience for the user. They have clear navigation, easy to read content, and overall benefit every type of user.

            WCAG, or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, are the standards for designing websites that allow web content to be accessible by people 
            with disabilites. This includes those with visual, auditory, cognitive or motor impairments. 
            They provide a framework for creating accessible web content, and have guidance on how to design these websites. 
            There are 3 main levels of accessibility. A, being the minimum level. AA is the middle level, and is considered to be the standard 
            for web accesibility. AAA is the highest level.
