        <h2>How to do it!</h2>
        <p>
            By adopting a universal design approach, designers consider factors such as navigation, readability, and interaction methods to accommodate the broadest range of users. 
            This approach brings a sense that good design should be accessible by everyone. It should be a place where where any user, no matter there abilities, can engage with the content with no problems. 
            A important part of this is understanding the users needs. From there you can begin to think about what needs they have.
            Desinging around Accessibility is way easier than doing it after the fact, and it can even save you money.

        <h3>Some Key Aspects</h3>
        <h4>Affordances: </h4>
        <p>Affordances are the percieved and actual properites of an environment that determines how to use it. Designing with a clear affordance can help users interact.
        This can be done in a ton of ways, such as having a sticker to show how to use it, or just have a design so simple humans intuitively know what to do with it.     

    </p>
    
        <h4>Mapping: </h4>
        <p>
            Mapping is the part of design that refers to the relationship of the controls and their effects. 
            The importance of of clear and natural mapping will allow easy of use for all users. 
            If you think of some good maps, often times they aren't cluttered and are easy to understand.

        <h4>Feedback: </h4>
        <p>
           Giving feedback when users do an action is great for the user experience. 
           This helps users understand the impact of their actions. 
           For example, think of a pinpad beeping everytime you press one of the numbers or buttons.

        <h4>Visibility: </h4>
        <p>
           All the important elements and functions should be visible and easily discoverable. A good example of this is having good contrast of colors, especially for text.
           As seen below, imagine trying to read a whole paper with yellow text on a white background. It is very hard to read.
           Some screen readers would be able to read it very easily, but you need to design with all users in mind.

        <h4>Semantic HTML: </h4>
        <p>
        One of the most important aspects of designing an accessible website is using semantic HTML. 
        This allows screen readers to be able to properly read the page to understand what is going on.
